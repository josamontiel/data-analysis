<!--

## Overview: 

This project attempts to paint a picture using data pulled from [The Boston Foundation](https://www.tbf.org/news-and-insights/reports//2022/October/2022%20Greater%20Boston%20Housing%20Report%20Card/2022%20GBHRC%20Charts#single) on the housing crisis as it pertains to:

* Single Family Home Prices (Jan-June 2021, Jan-June 2022)
* Median Condo Prices (2021-2022)
* Share of those owners being Black or Latino

### What is going to be highlighted: 

There will be a couple of parts to this project:

1. Obtaining the data
2. Exploring the data for any inconsistencies/missing values.
3. Cleaning the data (If Needed)
4. Presenting the data in a way that showcases the true nature of the Real Estate/Job market

### What I Hope To Accomplish:

The data is the data, I will not be manipulating the values input, I am doing this out in the open and citing my sources because transparency is key with matters like this. This data can be used by first time home buyers, flippers and wealthy folks looking to park their money in super expensive real estate. It's really not up to me or anyone to decide what to do with this kind of information. 

### Some reference:

The data being collected for this is pretty vague, there are some key points missing like (but not limited to): size of home in sq ft/meters, amount of bedrooms/bathrooms, year the home was built etc. 

But below I will be listing the relevant data associated with these data sets.
