## Overview

This project attempts to paint a picture using data pulled from [The Boston Foundation](https://www.tbf.org/news-and-insights/reports//2022/October/2022%20Greater%20Boston%20Housing%20Report%20Card/2022%20GBHRC%20Charts#single) on the housing crisis as it pertains to:

* Single Family Home Prices (Jan-June 2021, Jan-June 2022)
* Median Condo Prices (2021-2022)
* Share of those owners being Black or Latino

### What is going to be highlighted

There will be a couple of parts to this project:

1. Obtaining the data
2. Exploring the data for any inconsistencies/missing values.
3. Cleaning the data (If Needed)
4. Presenting the data in a way that showcases the true nature of the Real Estate/Job market
